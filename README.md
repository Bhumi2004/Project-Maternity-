#MATERNITY AND BABY HUB
#Maternity & Baby Hub App üöÄ
Welcome to the Maternity & Baby Hub App repository! This project is all about empowering expectant mothers with essential tools and resources to make their pregnancy journey smoother and less stressful. From symptom tracking to mental health support and baby milestones, our app is designed to be a supportive companion through every step of pregnancy and postpartum.

The Challenge
Pregnancy is a beautiful experience, but it comes with its own set of challenges‚Äîespecially for first-time moms who face uncertainty around symptoms, baby development, and mental well-being. We‚Äôve created a user-friendly app that combines tracking, guidance, and support in one place, helping mothers feel informed, confident, and supported throughout their journey.

#Our Solution üå∏
Our app provides a comprehensive set of features to address the needs of expecting and new mothers:

Pregnancy Tracker: Log symptoms, track trimester progress, monitor weight gain, and get insights on diet and wellness.
Baby Care: Monitor your baby's growth with 3D visualizations, vaccination reminders, feeding and sleep tracking, and key developmental milestones.
Mental Health Support: Access mental health resources, stress management tools, and virtual consultations with licensed professionals.
Community Forum: Connect with other moms, share experiences, ask questions, and build a supportive community.
AI-Powered Assistant: Get personalized advice, answers to common questions, and guidance on pregnancy and postpartum challenges.
Insurance Navigation: Understand maternity coverage, find in-network providers, and visualize covered hospitals on a map.
Real-time Video Consultations: Speak with healthcare providers for virtual consultations, anytime, anywhere.
Key Features üåü
Here‚Äôs a quick look at the app‚Äôs key features:

Onboarding: Simple, user-friendly setup to get you started right away.
Pregnancy Tracker & Baby Growth: Monitor pregnancy progress and baby development with intuitive visuals and guidance.
Mind & Community: Access mental health resources, relaxation techniques, and a community space to connect with other moms.
3D Baby Visualizations: Experience your baby‚Äôs growth in 3D, making development more engaging and interactive.
AI-Assistant: Get real-time insights and answers to your specific questions and needs.

Built With üíª
Our app is built with a powerful tech stack to ensure a smooth, responsive, and real-time experience:

Frontend: React, JavaScript, HTML, CSS
Backend: Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB Atlas
Cloud Platform: Vultr for hosting and scalability
Real-time Communication: Socket.io
Target Audience üéØ
Our app is designed with two main audiences in mind:

Primary: Expectant mothers, particularly first-time moms during their "fourth trimester."
Secondary: Healthcare providers and caregivers who want to support patients with real-time monitoring and remote consultations.
Feasibility & Scalability üîç
Technical Feasibility: The app‚Äôs tech stack (React, Node.js, MongoDB, socket.io) provides scalability and smooth performance, even for real-time features.
Complexity (Medium): Integrating AI, wearables, and external APIs adds complexity, but well-documented tools and APIs make this manageable.
Resource Allocation: Partnering with clinics and insurance providers enables licensed doctor consultations and comprehensive maternity coverage directly in the app.
